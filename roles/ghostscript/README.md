# Ghostscript

Downloads the Ghostscript source from https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases

By default it downloads gs10012/ghostscript-10.01.2.tar.gz version but this can be configured to any other existing version.

Then, it unzip the package and installs it on the machine.

## Why
The current ubuntu versions in amigo, do not provide the latest version of ghostscript. So using this role we can install any available version of the ghostscript.
