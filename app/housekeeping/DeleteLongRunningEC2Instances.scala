// TimeOutLongRunningBakes was failing to delete some long running EC2 instances.
// The issue was that the bake corresponding to the long running EC2 instance would have status Failed.
// This means it wouldn't be considered as a long running bake (status not equal to Running)
// and therefore it's corresponding EC2 instance wouldn't be considered for termination.
// To mitigate against this, 'go from the other direction' i.e. query for long running EC2 instances, terminate them
// and then set the status of the corresponding bake to timed out (if it's status is Running).
