# AMIgo

AMIgo is an application for baking AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).

## Terminology

* A __base image__ is the source AMI to use as the basis for an image. For example you might have an "Ubuntu Wily" base image.

* A __role__ is something installed or configured on the machine. For example if you want your machine to have a JVM, Node and nginx pre-installed, you would assign the corresponding roles to your image. Currently roles are implemented as Ansible roles.

* A __recipe__ is a description of how to bake your AMI. Making a recipe consists of choosing a base image and deciding which roles to assign. For example you might have a recipe that builds an image based on Ubuntu Wily and installs a JVM, Node and nginx.

* A __bake__ is a single execution of a recipe. The result of a bake is an AMI.

## Implementation

AMIgo is implemented as a Play application. It uses Packer and Ansible to bake AMIs.

### AMI baking process

Roughly, AMIgo does the following:

1. Dynamically generate an Ansible playbook based on the recipe's roles
2. Dynamically generate a Packer build configuration file to install and then run Ansible
3. Execute Packer as an external process
4. Parse the Packer output and extract useful information from it

All data (base images, recipes, bakes, bake logs) are stored in DynamoDB. The Dynamo tables are created automatically if they do not exist.

## How to run locally

AMIgo requires Packer to be [installed](https://www.packer.io/intro/getting-started/setup.html)

To run the Play app, you will need credentials in either the `deployTools` profile or the default profile.

If you want to actually perform a bake, you will need separate credentials for Packer. These must be available either as environment variables or in the default profile. (Packer doesn't play nicely with named profiles.) I'm not sure whether Packer understands federated credentials, session token, etc. I created an IAM user with limited permissions (see below) and use that user's credentials.

If you have created a custom VPC in your AWS account (i.e. your account contains any VPCs other than the default one), then you will also need to tell Packer which VPC and subnet to use when building images:

```
$ cat ~/.configuration-magic/amigo.conf

packer {
  vpcId = "vpc-1234abcd"
  subnetId = "subnet-5678efgh"
  instanceProfile = "[optional] instance profile name for the box packer will run on"
}
```

Once you have your credentials and config sorted out, just do: 

```
$ sbt run
```

## How to run the tests

```
$ sbt test
```

## Required AWS permissions for Packer
